    "## Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes is usually, applied to the text feature, since the word frequency usually fits the multinomial distribution. Import `MultinomialNB` to apply the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complement Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "ComplementNB implements the complement naive Bayes (CNB) algorithm. CNB is an adaptation of the standard multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm that is particularly suited for imbalanced data sets. Specifically, CNB uses statistics from the complement of each class to compute the modelâ€™s weights. The inventors of CNB show empirically that the parameter estimates for CNB are more stable than those for MNB. Further, CNB regularly outperforms MNB (often by a considerable margin) on text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "BernoulliNB implements the naive Bayes training and classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate Bernoulli distributions; i.e., there may be multiple features but each one is assumed to be a binary-valued (Bernoulli, boolean) variable. Therefore, this class requires samples to be represented as binary-valued feature vectors; if handed any other kind of data, a BernoulliNB instance may binarize its input (depending on the binarize parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of text classification, word occurrence vectors (rather than word count vectors) may be used to train and use this classifier. BernoulliNB might perform better on some datasets, especially those with shorter documents. It is advisable to evaluate both models, if time permits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorical Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "CategoricalNB implements the categorical naive Bayes algorithm for categorically distributed data. It assumes that each feature, which is described by the index \n",
    ", has its own categorical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm performs better for high dimension data and data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Out-of-core naive Bayes model fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes models can be used to tackle large scale classification problems for which the full training set might not fit in memory. To handle this case, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, and GaussianNB expose a partial_fit method that can be used incrementally as done with other classifiers as demonstrated in Out-of-core classification of text documents. All naive Bayes classifiers support sample weighting."
